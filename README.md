# PortMap
A responsive web map application template using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)

To get started you need to generate a Mapbox ID. Get your ID by creating a Mapbox account. Insert your Mapbox ID in assets/js/map.js on line 1. 

## What it does:
* Layer tree allows the user to interactively organize and reposition map layers using [Mapbox-GL-JS-Layer-Tree](https://github.com/TheGartrellGroup/Mapbox-GL-JS-Layer-Tree)
* Layer Tree pulls feature symbology automatically via [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/ )
* Supports drawing and editing using [Mapbox Draw API](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw)
* User can calculate area and length of drawn features using [Mapbox Turf](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-turf/)
* User can add labels directly to the map as a symbol layer using [Mapbox-GL-JS-Text-Markup](https://github.com/TheGartrellGroup/Mapbox-GL-JS-Text-Markup)
* User can easily find latitude and longitude by clicking on the map 
* Global address search using the [mapbox-gl-geocoder](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-geocoder)
* Search JSON Properties with autocomplete and zoom to feature
* Client side Print Export to PNG or PDF with legend: [Print/Export for Mapbox GL](https://github.com/TheGartrellGroup/Mapbox-GL-Print-Export-For-Port)
* Identify multiple features and view attributes in a modal
* Bookmark drop-down list
* Disclaimer modal 
* Scale bar 
* Not included in this repo: Save Views function allows the user to save Layer Tree configuration, Mapbox drawn features, Text Markups, and Zoom and Pitch. All plugins in this repo have code pre-built to work with the Save Views plugin: [Mapbox-GL-JS-save-view](https://github.com/TheGartrellGroup/Mapbox-GL-JS-save-view)
